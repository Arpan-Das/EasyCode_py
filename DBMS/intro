- What is Data?
Data are raw facts that have no meaning by themselves.
e.g. 100, Ravi, etc

CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION TO DBMS

- Database

A database is an organized collection of related data stored electronically so that it can be easily accessed, managed, and updated.

e.g. 
Strudent database, Employes Database .... 


- Database Management System (DBMS)

A DBMS is software that provides an interface between users and the database for storing, retrieving, updating, and managing data efficiently.

e.g. MySQL, Oracle, SQL Server 

- What is a Legacy System?

A file-based system where each application maintains its own data files.

student.txt
-- student ID
-- Student Name
-- roll no.
-- class

marks.txt
-- student id
-- student name
-- roll no.
-- marks

fees.txt
-- student id
-- student name
-- roll no. 
-- fees paid 

Problem : Each department keeps separate files.

Drawbacks
---------
1. Data Redundancy - Same data stored multiple times. 
---- Wastes Memory
---- Updating becomes difficult

2. Data Inconsistency - Same data has different values 
student file - studnet name - Ravee
marks file - studnet name - Rave
fees file - studnet name - Ravi

3. Data Isolation - Data scatteres across files and formats.

4. Difficult Data Access
e.g. list of students with marks > 80 and attendance > 75%

5. Integrity Problem - No rules for valid data.
e.g. age == -5 

6. Security Problems - no access control 

7. Concurency Problems - 
8. No Backup & Recovery


ADVANTAGES OF DBMS
------------------

1. Reduced Redundancy
---- Data stored once
---- Shared across applications

2. Data Consistency
Update once → reflected everywhere


3. Data Security

Login-based access
Role-based permissions


4. Data Integrity
Rules ensure correct data.
e.g. age > 0
