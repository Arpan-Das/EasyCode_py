"""
Loops in Python are used to repeat actions efficiently.
The main types are 
a) For loops (counting through items) and 

Syntax
for i in range(starting, ending, increment):
    statement

Note: starting <= 1 < ending
By Default increment is 1
By Default if one argument is assed it will set starting index a 0 

b) While loops (based on conditions).

Syntax:
while condition:
    statement

c) do-while loop
